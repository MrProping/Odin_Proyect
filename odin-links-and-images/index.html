    <!-- <a> is the anchor element, where you can anchor to any kind of resource on the internet -->
    <!-- href is the atribute that specifies the destination link -->
    <!-- target specifies where the linked resource will be opened
     _self to open on current tab, and _blank to open on new tab/window -->
    <!-- rel atribute decribe the relation between the current page and the linked document
     noopener prevents the opened link from gaining access to th ewebpage from wich it was opened
     noreferrer prevents the opened link from knowing wich webpage or resource has a link to it
     noreferrer also includes the noopener behaviur and thus can be used by itself as well -->
